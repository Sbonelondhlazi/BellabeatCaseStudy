---Cleaning process: Merged dailyActivity Excel file imported to SQL as strings instead of floats. I used the following code to cast strings to float.
---Started by creating a table
/*IF EXISTS(SELECT *
			FROM fitabase.dbo.dailyActivityCleaned)
DROP TABLE fitabase.dbo.dailyActivityCleaned

CREATE TABLE fitabase.dbo.dailyActivityCleaned
(Id FLOAT, ActivityDate DATETIME2(7), TotalSteps FLOAT, TotalDistance FLOAT, LoggedActiveDistance FLOAT,VeryActiveDistance FLOAT, ModeratelyActiveDistance FLOAT, 
	LightlyActiveDistance FLOAT, SedentaryActiveDistance FLOAT, VeryActiveMinutes FLOAT, FairlyActiveMinutes FLOAT, LightlyActiveMinutes FLOAT, SedentaryActiveMinutes FLOAT,
	Calories FLOAT)*/

---I then created a temporary table. 
/*WITH daily_cleaned AS (
	SELECT 
		Id,
		ActivityDate,
		CAST(TotalSteps AS FLOAT) AS TotalSteps,
		CAST(TotalDistance AS FLOAT) AS TotalDistance,
		CAST(LoggedActivitiesDistance AS FLOAT) AS LoggedActiveDistance,
		CAST(VeryActiveDistance AS FLOAT) AS VeryActiveDistance,
		CAST(ModeratelyActiveDistance AS FLOAT) AS ModeratelyActiveDistance,
		CAST(LightActiveDistance AS FLOAT) AS LightActiveDistance,
		CAST(SedentaryActiveDistance AS FLOAT) AS SedentaryActiveDistance,
		CAST(VeryActiveMinutes AS FLOAT) AS VeryActiveMinutes,
		CAST(FairlyActiveMinutes AS FLOAT) AS FairlyActiveMinutes,
		CAST(LightlyActiveMinutes AS FLOAT) AS LightlyActiveMinutes,
		CAST(SedentaryMinutes AS FLOAT) AS SedentaryActiveMinutes,
		CAST(Calories AS FLOAT) AS Calories

	FROM fitabase.dbo.dailyActivity
)*/

---Inserting data points into a new a table with cleaned values. Note: Execute once after creating a table.

/*INSERT INTO fitabase.dbo.dailyActivityCleaned
	(Id, ActivityDate, TotalSteps, TotalDistance, LoggedActiveDistance,VeryActiveDistance, ModeratelyActiveDistance, 
	LightlyActiveDistance, SedentaryActiveDistance, VeryActiveMinutes, FairlyActiveMinutes, LightlyActiveMinutes, SedentaryActiveMinutes,
	Calories)

	SELECT *

	FROM daily_cleaned*/




---I created another table showing the number of days each user tracked his/her physical activity

/*IF EXISTS(SELECT *                         ##Code for dropping the table if it already exists
	FROM fitabase.dbo.trackedDays)

DROP TABLE fitabase.dbo.trackedDays

CREATE TABLE fitabase.dbo.trackedDays
	(Id FLOAT, days_activity_recorded int)

INSERT INTO fitabase.dbo.trackedDays
(Id, days_activity_recorded)

---Determine number of days health device was used
SELECT
	Id,
	COUNT(ActivityDate) OVER (PARTITION BY Id) AS days_activity_recorded

FROM fitabase.dbo.dailyActivity

ORDER BY
	days_activity_recorded DESC*/


---Created 2 new tables summarizing sleep monitoring data. Note: Execute once only after creating the table
---I created these tables so that I can join them and use them in the analysis

/*IF EXISTS(SELECT *
	FROM fitabase.dbo.summarySleepDay)

DROP TABLE fitabase.dbo.summarySleepDay

CREATE TABLE fitabase.dbo.summarySleepDay                         ##No.1
	(Id FLOAT, TotalMinutesInBed INT, TotalMinutesAsleep INT)

INSERT INTO fitabase.dbo.summarySleepDay
(Id, TotalMinutesInBed, TotalMinutesAsleep)
SELECT
	Id,
	SUM(TotalTimeInBed) AS TotalMinutesInBed,
	SUM(TotalMinutesAsleep) AS TotalMinutesAsleep	
FROM 
	fitabase.dbo.sleepDay
GROUP BY
	Id*/




/*IF EXISTS(SELECT *
	FROM fitabase.dbo.summaryRestless)

DROP TABLE fitabase.dbo.summaryRestless

CREATE TABLE fitabase.dbo.summaryRestless     ##No.2
	(Id FLOAT, TotalMinutesRestless INT)

INSERT INTO fitabase.dbo.summaryRestless
(Id, TotalMinutesRestless)

SELECT 
	DISTINCT Id, 
	COUNT(value) OVER (PARTITION BY Id) AS TotalMinuteRestless
FROM fitabase.dbo.minuteSleep_state
WHERE
	value = 2 ---2 = Restless*/
